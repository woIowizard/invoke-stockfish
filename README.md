# invoke-stockfish

A script to automate engine analysis of live games on [LC](https://lichess.org/).<br>
*Engine assistance on rated games is against [LC's rules](https://lichess.org/terms-of-service).*

### getting started
You'll need to have downloaded [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/download/). Modify the first line of the script to include the file path of the executable file.

You'll also need the python packages in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). Install those with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Run the script without arguments. If the script asks for a username or game id after loading stockfish, your system meets the requirements.
